The Gameplay Framework of Unreal Engine provides a powerful set of classes to build your game. Your game can be a shooter, farm simulator, a deep RPG, it doesn’t matter. The framework is very flexible and does some heavy lifting and sets some standards. It has a pretty deep integration with the engine so my immediate advice is to stick to these classes instead of trying to ‘roll your own’ game framework as you might with engines like Unity. Understanding this framework is critical in being successful and efficient in building your projects.

# Who is this for?

Anyone who is interesting in building games with Unreal, specifically those in C++, and would like to learn more about Unreal’s Gameplay Framework. This post walks through the core classes you will use from the Gameplay Framework and explains their use, how they get instantiated by the engine and how to access each of those classes from other parts of your game code. Most of the information presented applies to Blueprint as well.

I have written [Complete Guide to Unreal C++](https://tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-cpp-guide) that works well together with this article. Another incredibly powerful game programming feature is [GameplayTags, and I explain why you should be using them](https://tomlooman.com/unreal-engine-gameplaytags-data-driven-design).

# Gameplay Framework Classes

When building games in Unreal Engine you’ll find a lot of boilerplate is already done for you. There are a handful of classes you’ll be using a lot in making games in C++ (or Blueprint for that matter).

## Actor

Perhaps the most used class in your game. `Actor`

is the base for any object in your level including players, AI enemies, doors, walls, and other gameplay entities. Actors are built-up from one or multiple `ActorComponent`

’s like `StaticMeshComponent`

, `CharacterMovementComponent`

, `AudioComponent`

and tons more. Even classes like `GameMode`

are Actors (even though a GameMode doesn’t have a ‘real’ position or other physical representation in the world).

`Actor`

is the class you can replicate easily for multiplayer. There is a lot that comes into play when dealing with effective networking in Actors, so I won’t be able to cover that in this article.

Actors support the concept receiving of damage out of the box. Damage can be applied directly to the Actor using `MyActor->TakeDamage()`

or via `UGameplayStatics::ApplyDamage()`

note there are variations available for PointDamage (eg. hitscan weapons) and RadialDamage for things like explosions. There is a great intro to [Damage in UE4](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/damage-in-ue4) on the official Unreal Engine site.

You can easily spawn a new Actor instance in code by using `GetWorld()->SpawnActor<T>();`

where T is the class to return, eg. AActor of one of your own types like AGadgetActor, AGameplayProp, etc.

Here is a snippet where an Actor is spawned at runtime:

```
FTransform SpawnTM; // Location, Rotation, Scale
FActorSpawnParameters SpawnParams;
SpawnParams.SpawnCollisionHandlingOverride = ESpawnActorCollisionHandlingMethod::AlwaysSpawn;
SpawnParams.Owner = GetOwner();
/* Attempt to assign an instigator (used for damage application) */
SpawnParams.Instigator = Cast<APawn>(GetOwner());
AActor* NewActorInstance = GetWorld()->SpawnActor<AActor>(ActorClassToSpawn, SpawnTM, SpawnParams);
```


There are many ways to get access to Actors, usually you would have a pointer/reference to the specific Actor you are interested in. In the sample above, we can keep the pointer to some newly spawned actor via the NewActorInstance variable and can start manipulating the Actor instance through that.

One especially useful function you may use when prototyping or getting to grips with the engine is `UGameplayStatics::GetAllActorsOfClass()`

this lets you grab an array of all actors of the class you pass in (including the derived classes, if you were to pass in Actor as the class you basically get ALL things in the level… probably not what you are looking for) The function is often feared and avoided as it’s not a very efficient way of interacting with your environment, but sometimes it’s the only tool you got.

Actors don’t actually own a translation, rotation, or scale. This is all set and retrieved via the RootComponent, eg. the top-level component in the hierarchy of SceneComponents (see below for more on SceneComponents) the very commonly used functions like `MyActor->GetActorLocation()`

actually go into the root component and returns its world location.

Here are some additional useful functions you’ll use within the context of an Actor:

### Actor Functions

**BeginPlay**// The ‘first’ function to be called once the Actor has spawned and is completely initialized. This is a good place to setup basic logic, a timer, or change some properties now that its fully initialized and can query its surroundings.**Tick**// Called every frame, for most Actors this will eventually be turned off for performance reason, but its enabled by default. Great for setting up dynamic logic quickly and checking stuff in a per-frame basis. Eventually you will find yourself moving more code to event-based logic or running timers to performance logic on lower frequencies.**EndPlay**// Called when the Actor is being removed from the world including a ‘EEndPlayReason’ which specifies why it was called.**GetComponentByClass**// Find a single component instance of specific class, very useful when you don’t have the exact type of the Actor but know it must contain a certain component type. There is also GetComponentsByClass to return all instances of the class, not just the first one found.**GetActorLocation**// And all its variations, *Rotation, *Scale including**SetActorLocation**etc.**NotifyActorBeginOverlap**// Neat for checking overlaps caused by any of its components. Quickly set up gameplay triggers this way.**GetOverlappingActors**// Easily find out what other Actors are currently overlapping ours, also a component variation is available:**GetOverlappingComponents**

The Actor class contains a LOT of functionality and variables. It’s the cornerstone class of the gameplay framework in Unreal Engine. A good way to further explore this class is by opening up the header file of `Actor.h`

in Visual Studio and see what functionality is available. There is more to cover here so let’s move on to the next class on our list.

**Recommended Reading**

## ActorComponent

Components live inside of Actors, common components include StaticMeshComponent, CharacterMovementComponent, CameraComponent, and SphereComponent. These components each handle one particular task like movement, physics interaction (eg. a collision volume to purely check for overlapping Actors) or to visually display something in the world like a player mesh.

A sub-class of this component is **SceneComponent**, and is the base class for anything with a Transform (Position, Rotation, Scale) and supports attachment. For example, you can attach your CameraComponent to a SpringArmComponent to setup a third-person camera, both have a transform and attachment is required to properly manage relative positions.

Components are most commonly created in the constructor of the Actor, you can also create and destroy components at runtime. First, let’s look at one of my Actor’s constructors.

```
ASEquippableActor::ASEquippableActor()
{
PrimaryActorTick.bCanEverTick = true;
MeshComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<UStaticMeshComponent>(TEXT("MeshComp"));
MeshComp->SetCollisionObjectType(ECC_WorldDynamic); // Just setting a property on our component
// Set our root component for other SceneComponents to attach to
RootComponent = MeshComp;
// not attached to anything (not a SceneComponent with a transform)
ItemComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<UItemComponent>(TEXT("ItemComp"));
}
```


The UStaticMeshComponent is created using the `CreateDefaultSubobject<T>`

(a function of Actor) and requires a name to be specified (you will see this name in the Blueprint’s component list) you’ll use this function a LOT if you create your game code in C++, but ONLY within the context of the constructor.

You may also notice we setup the MeshComp to be the new RootComponent. Now any SceneComponent must be attached to this mesh, which is easily done using the following line:

```
WidgetComp = CreateDefaultSubobject<UWidgetComponent>(TEXT("InteractWidgetComp"));
WidgetComp->SetupAttachment(MeshComp);
```


The SetupAttachment will handle the initial attaching for us and it expected to be called for ALL scene components except the RootComponent itself to be done in the constructor. You may wonder why my ItemComponent does not call this SetupAttachment function. This is simply because that component is an ActorComponent but NOT a SceneComponent and has no Transform (location, rotation, scale) and does therefore not need to be added to the hierarchy. The component will still be registered with the Actor regardless, as that is separate from the hierarchy meaning functions like MyActor->GetComponentByClass will return any ActorComponents and SceneComponents.

Together with Actor these Components are critical in building your game in both C++ and Blueprint. They truly are the building blocks for your game. You can easily create your own custom components and have them handle something specific in your game such as a HealthComponent that holds hitpoints and reacts to the damage the owning Actor receives.

During gameplay you can spawn your own components using the code below. This is different from the CreateDefaultSubobject which is for constructors only.

```
UActorComponent* SpawnedComponent = NewObject<UActorComponent>(this, UStaticMeshComponent::StaticClass(), TEXT("DynamicSpawnedMeshCompoent"));
if (SpawnedComponent)
{
SpawnedComponent->RegisterComponent();
}
```


Some built-in useful functionality for ActorComponents include

`TickComponent()`

// Just like the Actor’s Tick() runs every frame to do high frequency logic.`bool bIsActive`

and the functions associated like Activate, Deactivate, .. to enable/disable the component entirely (including the TickComponent) without destroying the component or removing it from the Actor.

To enable replication on the ActorComponent you must call SetIsReplicated(true) which is slightly different in name from the Actor’s function. This is only necessary if you are trying to replicate a specific piece of logic for this component like a variable on function calls, and so not all components on a replicated Actor need to be replicated.

##PlayerController

The primary class for a player, receiving the input of the user. A `PlayerController`

itself is not visually shown in the world, instead it will ‘Possess’ a `Pawn`

instance which defines the visual and physical representation of that player in the world. During gameplay a player may possess a number of different pawns (eg. a vehicle, or a fresh copy of the Pawn when respawning) while the `PlayerController`

instance remains the same throughout the duration of the level. This is important as there may also be moments where the `PlayerController`

does not possess any pawn at all. This means things like the opening of menus should be added to the `PlayerController`

and not the Pawn class.

In multiplayer games the `PlayerController`

only exists on the owning client and the server. This means in a game of 4 players, the server has 4 player controllers, and each client only has 1. This is very important in understanding where to put certain variables as when all players require a player’s variable to be replicated it should never exist in the `PlayerController`

but in the Pawn or even PlayerState (covered later) instead.

### Accessing PlayerControllers

`GetWorld()->GetPlayerControllerIterator()`

// GetWorld function is available in any UObject derived class`PlayerState->GetOwner()`

// owner of PlayerState is of type`Actor`

, you will need to cast it to`PlayerController`

yourself.`Pawn->GetController()`

// Only set when the pawn is currently ‘possessed’ (ie. controlled) by a`PlayerController`

.

This class contains a `PlayerCameraManager`

which handles view targets and camera calculations including camera shakes. Another important class the `PlayerController`

handles is `HUD`

and can be great for managing your UI (in-game HUD and menus).

Whenever a new player joins the GameMode, a new `PlayerController`

is created for this player via `Login()`

in the `GameModeBase`

class.

## AIController

Similar in concept to the `PlayerController`

class, but purely for AI agents instead of players. Will possess a Pawn (see below) much like the `PlayerController`

and is the ‘brain’ of the agent. Where the Pawn is the visual representation of the agent, the AIController is the decision-maker.

Behavior Trees run via this controller and so should any handling of perception data (what the AI can see and hear) and push the decisions into the Pawn to act.

### Accessing AIController

AIControllers can be accessed in the same way as `PlayerController`

s from inside a Pawn (via GetController()) and in Blueprint there is a “GetAIController” function available anywhere, the input is expected to be the Pawn that is controlled by AI.

### Spawning

AIControllers can be spawned automatically if desired by setting the variable “Auto Possess AI” in the Pawn class. Make sure you set “AI Controller Class” variable in the Pawn to your desired class when using this.

## Pawn

`Pawn`

is the physical and visual representation of what the player (or AI) is controlling. This can be a vehicle, soldier, turret, or anything that presents your game’s character. A common sub-class for `Pawn`

is `Character`

which implements a SkeletalMesh and more importantly a CharacterMovementComponent with tons of options for fine-tuning how your player can traverse the environment for standard bipedal movement.

In multiplayer games each Pawn instance is replicated to other clients. This means in 4 player game, both the server and each of the clients all have 4 pawn instances. It is not uncommon to “kill” a Pawn instance when the player dies and to spawn a fresh instance on player re-spawn. Keep this in mind for storing your data you want to keep beyond the single life of a player (or refrain from using this pattern altogether and keeping the pawn instance alive instead).

### Accessing Pawns

`PlayerController->GetPawn()`

// Only when the PC currently has a pawn possessed`GetWorld()->GetPawnIterator()`

// GetWorld is available in any Actor instance, returns ALL pawns including AI you may have.

### Spawned by

`GameModeBase`

spawns the Pawn via SpawnDefaultPawnAtTransform, the `GameModeBase`

class also specifies which Pawn class to spawn.

## GameModeBase

The primary class that specifies which classes should be spawned/used by the other systems (`PlayerController`

, `Pawn`

, `HUD`

, `GameState`

, `PlayerState`

, and more) and is commonly used to specify game rules for modes such as ‘Capture the Flag’ where it could handle the flags, or to handle ‘wave spawns’ in a wave-based shooter. This class handles other key features like spawning the player.

`GameMode`

is a sub-class of `GameModeBase`

and contains a few more features originally used by Unreal Tournament such as MatchState and other shooter-type features. My recommendation is to stick to GameModeBase as it has everything you need and nothing more.

In multiplayer the GameMode instance only exists on the server! This means no client ever has an instance. To replicate functions and store data you need for your GameMode you should consider `GameState`

or `GameStateBase`

which does exist on all clients and is made for specifically this purpose.

### Accessing GameMode

`GetWorld()->GetAuthGameMode()`

// GetWorld is available from any Actor instance.`GetGameState()`

// return GameState for replicating functions and/or variables`InitGame(...)`

// initialize some of the game rules including those provided on the URL (eg. “MyMap?MaxPlayersPerTeam=2”) which can be passed in with loading levels in the game.

## HUD

The user interface class. [Slate/UMG](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/creating-user-interfaces-with-umg-and-slate-in-unreal-engine). Most of your actual UI scripting will happen within Slate and UMG, but this class can still manage the overall HUD and in-game menus.

Multiplayer: Only exists on the client. Not suitable for replication. Is owned by the `PlayerController`

.

### Accessing HUD

`PlayerController->GetHUD()`

// Available in your local`PlayerController`


### Spawned by

Spawned through `PlayerController`

that owns the HUD instance.

## World

[World](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Runtime/Engine/Engine/UWorld/) is the top-level object representing a map in which Actors and Components will exist and rendered. Contains the persistent level and many other objects like GameState, GameMode, and arrays containing things like Pawns and Controllers currently on the map.

Line tracing and all its variations are done via the `World`

with functions like [LineTraceSingleByChannel](https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/API/Runtime/Engine/Engine/UWorld/LineTraceSingleByChannel) and many other variations like it.

### Accessing World

Easy to access by calling `GetWorld()`

inside classes derived from `UObject`

(this includes all the classes mentioned so far).

When trying to get the world instance in *static functions* you should pass in a `WorldContextObject`

which is basically just an input parameter that we can use to call `GetWorld()`

on. Here is an example from one of my header files:

```
static APlayerController* GetFirstLocalPlayerController(UObject* WorldContextObject);
```


## GameInstance

`GameInstance`

has one instance that persists throughout the session of the game from launch till shutdown. Traveling between maps and menus will maintain the same instance of this class. It can be used to provide event hooks of handling network errors, loading of user data like game settings and generally features that are not relevant to only a specific level of your game.

### Accessing GameInstance

`GetWorld()->GetGameInstance<T>();`

// where T is the class type eg.`GetGameInstance<UGameInstance>()`

or your own derived type.`Actor->GetGameInstance()`


## PlayerState

Container for variables to replicate between client/server for a specific player. Data container that doesn’t run much logic of his own. Since `PlayerController`

is not available on all clients and Pawns are often destroyed as players die, the PlayerState is a good place to store data that must be replicated or persist between deaths.

### Accessing PlayerState

Pawn has it as variable Pawn->PlayerState, also available in Controller->PlayerState. The PlayerState in Pawn is only assigned for as long as a Controller has possessed that Pawn, otherwise it’s a `nullptr`

.

A list of all current PlayerState instances (eg. all players currently in the match) is available via GameState->PlayerArray.

### Spawned by

Class to spawn is assigned in GameModeBase (PlayerStateClass) and spawned by `AController::InitPlayerState()`

.

### Remarks

- Primarily useful when working on multiplayer games.
- To use your derived PlayerState class, assign the class in your GameMode to ‘PlayerStateClass’.

## GameStateBase

Similar to PlayerState, but for clients about GameMode information. Since GameMode instance doesn’t exist on clients, but only on server this is a useful container to replicate information like match time elapsed or team scores etc.

Comes in two variations, GameState and GameStateBase where GameState handles the extra variables required by GameMode (as opposed to `GameModeBase`

)

### Accessing GameStateBase

`World->GetGameState<T>()`

// where T is the class to cast to, example:`GetGameState<AGameState>()`

`MyGameMode->GetGameState()`

// stored and available in your GameMode instance (only relevant on server which owns the only instance of GameMode), clients should use the above call instead.

### Remarks

Use GameState**Base** over GameState unless your GameMode derives from GameMode instead of `GameModeBase`

.

## UObject

The base object for almost anything in the engine, Actors derive from UObject and so do the other core classes like GameInstance.

### Spawning UObjects

UObjects are not spawned like Actors, but created using `NewObject<T>()`

for example:

```
TSubclassOf<UObject> ClassToCreate;
UObject* NewDesc = NewObject<UObject>(this, ClassToCreate);
```


### Remarks

Can be used with networking, but requires some extra setup in the object class, and the objects need to be stored inside an Actor.

## GameplayStatics

Static class to handle common game-related functionality like playing sounds and spawning particle effects, spawning Actors, applying damage to Actors, getting playerpawn, `PlayerController`

, etc. The bottom line is this class is very useful for all sorts of gameplay access. All functions are static which means you don’t need to own a pointer to an instance of this class and can call functions directly from anywhere as seen below.

### Accessing GameplayStatics

Since GameplayStatics is a UBlueprintFunctionLibrary you can access it from anywhere in your code (or Blueprint for that matter)

```
UGameplayStatics::WhateverFunction(); // static functions are easily accessed anywhere, just include #include "Kismet/GameplayStatics.h"
```


### Remarks

Filled with useful functions, and a must-know class when making any game. Definitely recommend [browsing the class](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Runtime/Engine/Kismet/UGameplayStatics/) to see what’s available.
