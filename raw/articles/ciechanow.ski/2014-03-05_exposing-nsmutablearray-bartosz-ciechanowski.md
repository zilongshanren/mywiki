I’ve always wondered how `NSMutableArray`

works internally. Don’t get me wrong, immutable arrays certainly provide enormous benefits: not only are they thread safe but also copying them is essentially free. It doesn’t change the fact that they’re quite dull – their contents can’t be modified. I find the actual memory manipulation details fascinating and this is why this article focuses on mutable arrays.

Since I more or less describe the complete process I used to investigate `NSMutableArray`

, this post is fairly technical. There is an entire section discussing the ARM64 assembly, so if you find that boring then do not hesitate to skip it. Once we’re through the low level details, I present the *non obvious* characteristics of the class.

Implementation details of `NSMutableArray`

are private for a reason. They’re subject to change at any time, both in terms of underlying subclasses and their ivar layouts, as well as underpinning algorithms and data structures. Regardless of those caveats, it’s worth peeking under the hood of `NSMutableArray`

and figuring out how it works and what can be expected of it. The following study is based on iOS 7.0 SDK.

As usual, you can find the accompanying Xcode project [on my GitHub](https://github.com/Ciechan/NSMutableArrayExplorer).

Every self-respecting programmer knows how C arrays work. It boils down to a continuous segment of memory that can be easily read from and written into. While arrays and pointers are not the same (see [“Expert C Programming”](http://www.amazon.com/Expert-Programming-Peter-van-Linden/dp/0131774298) or [this article](http://eli.thegreenplace.net/2009/10/21/are-pointers-and-arrays-equivalent-in-c/)), it’s not much of an abuse to consider “`malloc`

-ed block of memory” as an array.

One of the most obvious drawbacks of using linear memory is that inserting an element at index 0 requires shifting all the other elements via means of `memmove`

:

![Inserting to C array at index 0](../../assets/1c4468c517ae4e51.jpg)

Inserting to C array at index 0

Similarly, removing the first element requires shifting action as well, assuming one wants to keep the same memory pointer as an address of the first element:

![Removing from C array at index 0](../../assets/966d8cf0fac9d880.jpg)

Removing from C array at index 0

For very large arrays this quickly becomes a problem. Obviously, direct pointer access is not necessarily the highest level of abstraction in the world of arrays. While C-style arrays are often useful, the daily bread and butter of Obj-C programmers wanting a mutable, indexed container is `NSMutableArray`

.

Even though Apple [publishes source code](http://opensource.apple.com) for many libraries, Foundation and its `NSMutableArray`

is not open sourced. However, there are some tools that make unrevealing its mysteries a little bit easier. We begin our journey at the highest possible level, reaching into the lower layers to get otherwise inaccessible details.

`NSMutableArray`

is a class cluster – its concrete implementations are actually subclasses of `NSMutableArray`

itself. Instances of which class does actually `+[NSMutableArray new]`

return? With LLDB we don’t even have to write any code to figure that out:

```
(lldb) po [[NSMutableArray new] class]
__NSArrayM
```


With class name in hand we reach for [class-dump](http://stevenygard.com/projects/class-dump/). This handy utility forges the class headers obtained by analyzing provided binaries. Using the following one-liner we can extract the ivar layout we’re interested in:

```
./class-dump --arch arm64 /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/Developer/SDKs/iPhoneOS7.0.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/CoreFoundation | pcregrep -M "^[@\w\s]*__NSArrayM[\s\w:{;*]*}"
```


I suck at regular expressions so the one used above is probably not a masterpiece, but it provides fruitful results:

```
@interface __NSArrayM : NSMutableArray
{
unsigned long long _used;
unsigned long long _doHardRetain:1;
unsigned long long _doWeakAccess:1;
unsigned long long _size:62;
unsigned long long _hasObjects:1;
unsigned long long _hasStrongReferences:1;
unsigned long long _offset:62;
unsigned long long _mutations;
id *_list;
}
```


The bitfields in the original output are typed with `unsigned int`

, but obviously you can’t fit 62 bits into a 32-bit integer – class-dump hasn’t been patched yet to parse ARM64 libraries correctly. Despite those minor flaws, one can tell quite a lot about the class just by looking at its ivars.

The most important tool in my investigation was [Hopper](http://www.hopperapp.com). I’m in love with this disassembler. It’s an essential tool for curious souls who have to know how everything works. One of the best features of Hopper is that it generates C-like pseudocode that very often is clear enough to grasp the gist of the implementation.

The crucial method for understanding `__NSArrayM`

is `- objectAtIndex:`

. While Hopper does great job providing pseudocode for ARMv7, the feature doesn’t work for ARM64 yet. I figured it would be an excellent exercise to do this manually, with some hints from its ARMv7 counterpart.

With [ARMv8 Instruction Set Overview](https://silver.arm.com/download/ARM_and_AMBA_Architecture/AR100-DA-70501-r0p0-00eac5/ARMv8_ISA_PRD03-GENC-010197-30-0.pdf) (registration required) in one hand and a bunch of educated guesses in another I *think* I’ve deciphered the assembly correctly. However, you should not treat the following analysis as an ultimate source of wisdom. I’m new at this.

As a start point let’s note that every Obj-C method is actually a C function with two additional parameters. The first one is `self`

which is a pointer to the object being receiver of the method call. The second one is `_cmd`

which represents the current selector.

One might say that the equivalent C-style declaration of the `- objectAtIndex:`

function is:

```
id objectAtIndex(NSArray *self, SEL _cmd, NSUInteger index);
```


Since on ARM64 these types of parameters are passed in the consecutive registers, we can expect the `self`

pointer to be in `x0`

register, the `_cmd`

in `x1`

register and the `index`

of object in `x2`

register. For details of parameter passing please reference the [ARM Procedure Call Standard](http://infocenter.arm.com/help/topic/com.arm.doc.ihi0055b/IHI0055B_aapcs64.pdf), noting that Apple’s iOS version has [some divergences](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Xcode/Conceptual/iPhoneOSABIReference/Articles/ARM64FunctionCallingConventions.html).

This will look scary. Since analyzing a large chunk of assembly at once is not sane, we’re going to walk through the following code step by step, figuring out what each line does.

```
0xc2d4 stp x29, x30, [sp, #0xfffffff0]!
0xc2d8 mov x29, sp
0xc2dc sub sp, sp, #0x20
0xc2e0 adrp x8, #0x1d1000
0xc2e4 ldrsw x8, [x8, #0x2c]
0xc2e8 ldr x8, [x0, x8]
0xc2ec cmp x8, x2
0xc2f0 b.ls 0xc33c
0xc2f4 adrp x8, #0x1d1000
0xc2f8 ldrsw x8, [x8, #0x30]
0xc2fc ldr x8, [x0, x8]
0xc300 lsr x8, x8, #0x2
0xc304 adrp x9, #0x1d1000
0xc308 ldrsw x9, [x9, #0x34]
0xc30c ldr x9, [x0, x9]
0xc310 add x9, x2, x9, lsr #2
0xc314 cmp x8, x9
0xc318 csel x8, xzr, x8, hi
0xc31c sub x8, x9, x8
0xc320 adrp x9, #0x1d1000
0xc324 ldrsw x9, [x9, #0x38]
0xc328 ldr x9, [x0, x9]
0xc32c ldr x0, [x9, x8, lsl #3]
0xc330 mov sp, x29
0xc334 ldp x29, x30, [sp], #0x10
0xc338 ret
```


We begin with what seems to be an ARM64 [function prologue](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_prologue). We’re saving `x29`

and `x30`

registers on the stack then we move the current stack pointer `sp`

to `x29`

register:

```
0xc2d4 stp x29, x30, [sp, #0xfffffff0]!
0xc2d8 mov x29, sp
```


We make some room on the stack (subtracting, since stack grows downwards):

```
0xc2dc sub sp, sp, #0x20
```


The path code we’re interested in doesn’t seem to be using this space. However, the “out of bounds” exception throwing code does call some other functions thus the prologue has to facilitate both options.

The next two lines perform [program counter relative addressing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Addressing_mode#PC-relative_2). The specifics of addresses encoding are [quite complicated](http://kitoslab.blogspot.com/2012/10/armv8-aarch64-instruction-encoding.html) and the literature is scarce, however, Hopper automatically calculates more sane offsets:

```
0xc2e0 adrp x8, #0x1d1000
0xc2e4 ldrsw x8, [x8, #0x2c]
```


The two lines will fetch contents of memory located at `0x1d102c`

and store it into `x8`

register. What’s over there? Hopper is kind enough to help us:

```
_OBJC_IVAR_$___NSArrayM._used:
0x1d102c dd 0x00000008
```


This is the offset of `_used`

ivar inside the `__NSArrayM`

class. Why go through the trouble of additional fetch, instead of simply putting the value `8`

into the assembly? It’s because of [fragile base class](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fragile_base_class) problem. The modern Objective-C runtime handles this by giving itself an option to overwrite the value at `0x1d102c`

(and all the other ivar offsets for that matter). If either `NSObject`

, or `NSArray`

, or `NSMutableArray`

adds new ivars, the old binaries will still work.

![The runtime can modify the ivars' offsets dynamically without breaking compatibility](../../assets/64ddb082cff2b1cb.jpg)

The runtime can modify the ivars' offsets dynamically without breaking compatibility

While the CPU has to do an additional memory fetch, this is a beautiful solution as explained in more details [on Hamster Emporium](http://www.sealiesoftware.com/blog/archive/2009/01/27/objc_explain_Non-fragile_ivars.html) and [Cocoa with Love](http://www.cocoawithlove.com/2010/03/dynamic-ivars-solving-fragile-base.html).

At this point we know the offset of `_used`

within the class. And since the Obj-C objects are nothing more than `struct`

s, and we’ve got pointer to this struct in `x0`

, all we have to do is fetch the value:

```
0xc2e8 ldr x8, [x0, x8]
```


The C equivalent of the above code would be:

```
unsigned long long newX8 = *(unsigned long long *)((char *)(__bridge void *)self + x8);
```


I think I prefer the assembly version. Quick analysis of disassembled `- count`

method of `__NSArrayM`

reveals that the `_used`

ivar contains the number of elements in `__NSArrayM`

, and as of this moment we have this value in `x8`

register.

Having requested index in `x2`

and count in `x8`

the code compares the two:

```
0xc2ec cmp x8, x2
0xc2f0 b.ls 0xc33c
```


When the value of `x8`

is lower or same as `x2`

then we jump to the code at `0xc33c`

, which handles the exception throwing. This is essentially the bounds checking. If we fail the test (count is lower or equal to index), we throw exception. I’m not going to discuss those parts of disassembly since they don’t really introduce anything new. If we pass the test (count is greater than index) then we simply keep executing instructions in order.

We’ve seen this before, this time we fetch the offset of `_size`

ivar located at `0x1d1030`

:

```
0xc2f4 adrp x8, #0x1d1000
0xc2f8 ldrsw x8, [x8, #0x30]
```


Then we retrieve its contents and shift it to the right by two bits:

```
0xc2fc ldr x8, [x0, x8]
0xc300 lsr x8, x8, #0x2
```


What’s the shift for? Let’s take a look at the dumped header:

```
unsigned long long _doHardRetain:1;
unsigned long long _doWeakAccess:1;
unsigned long long _size:62;
```


It turns out, all three bitfields share the same storage, so to get the actual value of `_size`

, we have to shift value to the right, discarding the bits for `_doHardRetain`

and `_doWeakAccess`

. Ivar offsets for `_doHardRetain`

and `_doWeakAccess`

are exactly the same, but their bit accessing code is obviously different.

Going further it’s the same drill, we get the contents of `_offset`

ivar (at `0x1d1034`

) into `x9`

register:

```
0xc304 adrp x9, #0x1d1000
0xc308 ldrsw x9, [x9, #0x34]
0xc30c ldr x9, [x0, x9]
```


In the next line we add the requested index stored in `x2`

to the 2-bits-right-shifted `_offset`

(it’s also a 62 bits-wide bitfield) and then we store it all back in `x9`

. Isn’t assembly just amazing?

```
0xc310 add x9, x2, x9, lsr #2
```


The next three lines are the most important ones. First of all, we compare the `_size`

(in `x8`

) with `_offset + index`

(in `x9`

):

```
0xc314 cmp x8, x9
```


Then we conditionally select value of one register based on the result of previous comparison:

```
0xc318 csel x8, xzr, x8, hi
```


This is more or less equal to ?: operator in C:

```
x8 = hi ? xzr : x8; /* csel x8, xzr, x8, hi */
```


The `xzr`

register is a *zero register* which contains value `0`

, and the `hi`

is the name of [condition code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_register) the `csel`

instruction should inspect. In this case we’re checking whether the result of comparison was higher (if value of `x8`

was greater than that of `x9`

).

Finally we subtract the new value of `x8`

from the `_offset + index`

(in `x9`

) and we store it in `x8`

again:

```
0xc31c sub x8, x9, x8
```


So what just happened? First of all let’s look into equivalent C code:

```
int tempIndex = _offset + index; /* add x9, x2, x9, lsr #2 */
BOOL isInRange = _size > tempIndex; /* cmp x8, x9 */
int diff = isInRange ? 0 : _size; /* csel x8, xzr, x8, hi */
int fetchIndex = tempIndex - diff; /* sub x8, x9, x8 */
```


In the C code we don’t have to shift neither `_size`

nor `_offset`

to the right, since compiler does this automatically for bitfields access.

We’re almost there. Let’s fetch the contents of `_list`

ivar (`0x1d1038`

) into `x9`

register:

```
0xc320 adrp x9, #0x1d1000
0xc324 ldrsw x9, [x9, #0x38]
0xc328 ldr x9, [x0, x9]
```


At this moment the `x9`

points to the beginning of memory segment containing the data.

Finally, shift the value of fetch index stored in `x8`

to the left by 3 bits, add it to the `x9`

and put the contents of memory at that location into `x0`

:

```
0xc32c ldr x0, [x9, x8, lsl #3]
```


Two things are important here. First of all, every data offset is in bytes. Shifting a value to the left by 3 is equivalent to multiplying it by 8, which is the size of a pointer on a 64-bit architecture. Secondly, the results goes into `x0`

which is the register which stores the return value of a function returning `NSUInteger`

.

At this point we are done. We have fetched the correct value stored in array.

There rest are some boilerplate operations that restore the state of registers and stack pointer before the call. We’re reversing the function’s prologue and returning:

```
0xc330 mov sp, x29
0xc334 ldp x29, x30, [sp], #0x10
0xc338 ret
```


I explained *what* the code does, but the question we will now answer is *why*?

Let’s do a quick summary of what each ivar means:

`_used`

is count`_list`

is a pointer to the buffer`_size`

is size of the buffer`_offset`

is an index of the first element of the array stored in the buffer

With ivars in mind and the disassembly analyzed we now can write an equivalent Objective-C code that performs the very same actions:

```
- (id)objectAtIndex:(NSUInteger)index
{
if (_used <= index) {
goto ThrowException;
}
NSUInteger fetchOffset = _offset + index;
NSUInteger realOffset = fetchOffset - (_size > fetchOffset ? 0 : _size);
return _list[realOffset];
ThrowException:
// exception throwing code
}
```


Assembly was definitely much more long-winded.

The most crucial part is deciding whether the `realOffset`

should be equal to `fetchOffset`

(subtracting zero) or `fetchOffset`

minus `_size`

. Since staring at dry code doesn’t necessarily paint the perfect picture, let’s consider two examples of how object fetching works.

In this example, the offset is relatively low:

![A simple example](../../assets/54782fbc1f2e3e8e.jpg)

A simple example

To fetch object at index `0`

we calculate the `fetchOffset`

as `3 + 0`

. Since `_size`

is larger than `fetchOffset`

the `realOffset`

is equal to `3`

as well. The code returns value of `_list[3]`

. Fetching object at index `4`

makes `fetchOffset`

equal to `3 + 4`

and the code returns `_list[7]`

.

What happens when offset is large?

![A more difficult example](../../assets/663b2abf8d294c34.jpg)

A more difficult example

Fetching object at index `0`

makes `fetchOffset`

equal to `7 + 0`

and the call returns `_list[7]`

as expected. However, fetching object at index `4`

makes `fetchOffset`

equal to `7 + 4 = 11`

, which is larger than `_size`

. Obtaining `realOffset`

requires subtracting `_size`

value from `fetchOffset`

which makes it `11 - 10 = 1`

and the method returns `_list[1]`

.

We’re essentially doing modulo arithmetic, *circling* back to the other end of the buffer when crossing the buffer boundary.

As you might have guessed, `__NSArrayM`

makes use of [circular buffer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circular_buffer). This data structure is extremely simple, but a little bit more sophisticated than a regular array/buffer. The contents of a circular buffer can wrap around when either end is reached.

Circular buffers have some very cool properties. Notably, unless the buffer is full, insertion/deletion from either end doesn’t require any memory to be moved. Let’s analyze how the class utilizes circular buffer to be superior in its behavior in comparison to a C array.

While reverse-engineering the rest of the disassembled methods would provide the definite explanation of `__NSArrayM`

internals, we can employ the discovered points of data to investigate the class at a higher level.

To inspect `__NSArrayM`

at runtime we can’t simply paste in the dumped header. First of all, the test application won’t link without providing at least empty `@implementation`

block for the `__NSArrayM`

class. Adding this `@implementation`

block is probably not a good idea. While the app builds and actually runs, I’m not entirely sure how does the runtime decide which class to use (if you *do* know, please let me know). For the sake of safety I’ve renamed the class name to something unique - `BCExploredMutableArray`

.

Secondly, ARC won’t let us compile the `id *_list`

ivar without specifying its ownership. We’re not going to write into the ivar, so prepending `id`

with `__unsafe_unretained`

*should* not interfere with ARC’s memory management. However, I’ve chosen to declare the ivar as `void **_list`

and it will soon become clear why.

We can create a category on `NSMutableArray`

that will print the contents of ivars as wells as the list of all the pointers contained within the array:

|
|

Let’s consider a very simple example:

|
|

The output shows that removing object at index 0 twice simply clears the pointers and moves the `_offset`

ivar accordingly:

```
Size: 6
Count: 3
Offset: 2
Storage: 0x178245ca0
[0] 0x0
[1] 0x0
[2] 0xb000000000000022
[3] 0xb000000000000032
[4] 0xb000000000000042
[5] 0x0
```


Here’s the visual interpretation of what’s going on:

![Removing object at index 0 twice](../../assets/bfd372834985f5f2.jpg)

Removing object at index 0 twice

What about adding objects? Let’s run another test on a brand new array:

|
|

Inserting object at index 0 uses the circular buffer magic to put the newly inserted object at the end of the buffer:

```
Size: 6
Count: 5
Offset: 5
Storage: 0x17004a560
[0] 0xb000000000000002
[1] 0xb000000000000012
[2] 0xb000000000000022
[3] 0xb000000000000032
[4] 0x0
[5] 0xb0000000000000f2
```


And visually:

![Adding object at index 0](../../assets/ba0ecfe5c44a1b98.jpg)

Adding object at index 0

This is fantastic news! It means that `__NSArrayM`

can be processed from *either* side. You can use `__NSArrayM`

as either stack or queue without any performance hits.

On a side note, you can see how on 64-bit architectures `NSNumber`

uses [tagged pointers](http://objectivistc.tumblr.com/post/7872364181/tagged-pointers-and-fast-pathed-cfnumber-integers-in) to do its storage.

OK, for this one I’ve cheated a little bit. While I’ve done some empirical testing as well, I wanted to have the exact value and I’ve peeked into the disassembly of `insertObject:atIndex:`

. Whenever the buffer gets full, it is reallocated with 1.625 times larger size. I was quite astonished for it not to be equal to 2.

**Update:** Mike Curtiss has [provided](https://twitter.com/mcurtiss/status/441432739523198977) a [very good explanation](https://github.com/facebook/folly/blob/master/folly/docs/FBVector.md#memory-handling) of why making resizing factor equal to 2 is suboptimal.

This is a shocker – `__NSArrayM`

never reduces its size! Let’s run the following test code:

|
|

Even though at this point the array is empty, it still keeps the large buffer:

```
Size: 14336
```


This is not something you should worry about unless you use the `NSMutableArray`

to load in some enormous amounts of data and then clear the array with the intention of freeing the space.

Let’s allocate new arrays with initial capacity set to consecutive powers of two:

|
|

Surprise surprise:

```
Size:2 // requested capacity - 1
Size:2 // requested capacity - 2
Size:4 // requested capacity - 4
Size:8 // requested capacity - 8
Size:16 // requested capacity - 16
Size:16 // requested capacity - 32
Size:16 // requested capacity - 64
Size:16 // requested capacity - 128
... // Size:16 all the way down
```


This is barely important, but I found it nonetheless interesting:

|
|

And the output:

```
Size: 6
Count: 3
Offset: 3
Storage: 0x17805be10
[0] 0xb000000000000002
[1] 0xb000000000000002
[2] 0xb000000000000002
[3] 0xb000000000000002
[4] 0xb000000000000042
[5] 0xb000000000000052
```


The `__NSArrayM`

doesn’t bother clearing previous space when moving its objects forward. However, the objects *do* get deallocated. It’s not the `NSNumber`

doing its magic either, `NSObject`

acts correspondingly.

This explains why I’ve opted for defining `_list`

ivar as `void **`

. If the `_list`

was declared as `id *`

then the following loop would crash on the `object`

assignment:

```
for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
id object = array->_list[i];
NSLog("%p", object);
}
```


ARC implicitly inserts a retain/release pair causing it to access deallocated objects. While prepending `id object`

with `__unsafe_unretained`

fixes the problem, I absolutely didn’t want *anything* to call any methods on this bunch of stray pointers. That’s my `void **`

reasoning.

In these two examples we will remove elements from roughly the middle of the array:

|
|

In output we see that the top part shifts down, where down are lower indexes (notice the stray pointer at `[5]`

)

```
[0] 0xb000000000000002
[1] 0xb000000000000012
[2] 0xb000000000000022
[3] 0xb000000000000042
[4] 0xb000000000000052
[5] 0xb000000000000052
```


![Removing object at index 3](../../assets/af1e9eff904b9705.jpg)

Removing object at index 3

However, when we call `[array removeObjectAtIndex:2]`

instead, the bottom part shifts up, where up are higher indexes:

```
[0] 0xb000000000000002
[1] 0xb000000000000002
[2] 0xb000000000000012
[3] 0xb000000000000032
[4] 0xb000000000000042
[5] 0xb000000000000052
```


![Removing object at index 2](../../assets/10be4e85397ce2fd.jpg)

Removing object at index 2

Inserting object in the middle has very similar results. The reasonable explanation is `__NSArrayM`

tries to minimize the amount of memory moved, thus it will move at most *half* of its elements.

As discussed in [NSMutableArray Class Reference](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/Foundation/Classes/NSMutableArray_Class/Reference/Reference.html) every `NSMutableArray`

subclass **must** implement the following seven methods:

`- count`

`- objectAtIndex:`

`- insertObject:atIndex:`

`- removeObjectAtIndex:`

`- addObject:`

`- removeLastObject`

`- replaceObjectAtIndex:withObject:`


Unsurprisingly, `__NSArrayM`

fulfills this requirement. However, the list of all the methods implemented by `__NSArrayM`

is quite short and doesn’t contain 21 additional methods listed in `NSMutableArray`

header. Who’s responsible for executing those methods?

It turns out they’re all part of the `NSMutableArray`

class itself. This is extremely convenient – any subclass of `NSMutableArray`

can implement only the seven most rudimentary methods. All the other higher-level abstractions are built on top of them. For instance `- removeAllObjects`

method simply iterates backwards, calling `- removeObjectAtIndex:`

one by one. Here’s pseudo code:

However, where it makes sense `__NSArrayM`

*does* reimplement some of its superclasses' methods. For instance, while `NSArray`

provides the default implementation for `- countByEnumeratingWithState:objects:count:`

method of [NSFastEnumeration](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Reference/NSFastEnumeration_protocol/) protocol, `__NSArrayM`

has its own code-path as well. Knowing its internal storage `__NSArrayM`

can provide much more efficient implementation.

I’ve always had this idea of Foundation being a thin wrapper on CoreFoundation. My argument was simple – there is no need to reinvent the wheel with brand new implementations of NS* classes when the CF* counterparts are available. I was shocked to realize neither `NSArray`

nor `NSMutableArray`

have anything in common with `CFArray`

.

The best thing about CFArray is that it’s [open sourced](http://opensource.apple.com/source/CF/CF-855.11/CFArray.c). This will be a very quick overview, since the source code is publicly available, eagerly waiting to be read. The most important function in `CFArray`

is [_CFArrayReplaceValues](https://gist.github.com/Ciechan/9258194#file-cfarray-c-L923). It’s called by:

[CFArrayAppendValue](https://gist.github.com/Ciechan/9258194#file-cfarray-c-L693)[CFArraySetValueAtIndex](https://gist.github.com/Ciechan/9258194#file-cfarray-c-L703)[CFArrayInsertValueAtIndex](https://gist.github.com/Ciechan/9258194#file-cfarray-c-L729)[CFArrayRemoveValueAtIndex](https://gist.github.com/Ciechan/9258194#file-cfarray-c-L760)[CFArrayReplaceValues](https://gist.github.com/Ciechan/9258194#file-cfarray-c-L918)(notice the lack of leading underscore).

Basically, `CFArray`

moves the memory around to accommodate the changes in the most efficient fashion, similarly to how `__NSArrayM`

does its job. However, the `CFArray`

does *not* use a circular buffer! Instead it has a larger buffer padded with zeros from both ends which makes enumeration and fetching the correct object much easier. Adding elements at either end simply eats up the remaining padding.

Even though `CFArray`

has to serve slightly more general purposes, I find it fascinating that its internals don’t work the same way as `__NSArrayM`

does. While I suppose it would make sense to find common ground and make a single, canonical implementation, perhaps there are some other factors that influenced the separation.

What those two have in common? They’re the concrete implementation of abstract data type known as [deque](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double-ended_queue). Despite its name, `NSMutableArray`

is an array on steroids, deprived of C-style counterpart’s drawbacks.

Personally, I’m most delighted with constant-time performance of insertion/deletion from either end. I no longer have to question myself using `NSMutableArray`

as queue. It works perfectly fine.
