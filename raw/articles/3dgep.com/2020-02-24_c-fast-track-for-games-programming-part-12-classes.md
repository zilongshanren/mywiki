In this part, we will build on the code from our work with [Tiles](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-11-tiles/). We aim to place this in a more reusable and understandable structure – this is where classes come in.

[Data Structures](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-13-data-structures/)For this tutorial, we’ll be using the same template from the [2nd tutorial](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-2-template/):

In case you need a starting point, here is some code that will do for today:

If you didn’t download the [nc2tiles.png](https://www.3dgep.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/nc2tiles.png) image file from the [previous tutorial](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-11-tiles/), then don’t forget to download the image below and save it in the assets folder where you extracted [TheTemplate.zip](https://www.3dgep.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/TheTemplate.zip) file.

Open the `game.cpp`

file and replace the contents of the file with the following source code:

There are some problems with this code, and we’ll fix these problems using *classes*, which allow us to encapsulate functionality.

Your game world consists of **objects**. Take the [last episode](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-11-tiles/) for example: we have a player **tank**, a **backdrop** (which consists of **tile**s), a **screen** that we draw to. Later on, we might want to add **bullet**s, enemies (**enemy**), more **level**s and so on. This is a list of *things*, not a list of operations.

You could actually argue that the most logical way to start thinking about what a game will do is actually: what *objects* do I need? And, slightly more detailed: what do these objects *do*? What *properties* do these objects have? And what is the *relationship* between objects?

Note that this is something you have already been using. Consider the default code in the `Game::Tick`

method:

|
30
31
32
33
34
35
|
void Game::Tick( float deltaTime )
{
// clear the graphics window
screen->Clear( 0 );
...
}
|

When you open up `game.h`

you will see that your game has a `screen`

variable, which is an object. The type of this object is `Surface`

. In the default template code we are telling this surface to do things: it’s asked to clear itself, and to print something. A `Surface`

can do more: you can find out what by looking at `surface.h`

, line `37`

. There you will see that a `Surface`

can also `Resize`

itself, amongst other things. A `Surface`

also has some properties: `width`

, `height`

, `Pixel`

buffer, and some other things. The things that the `Surface`

can do are called *methods*. The properties of an object are called *member variables*, or just *properties*.

Let’s apply this in a more interesting way. In the previous tutorial, you added a player-controlled tank, with collision detection, to a tile-based backdrop. In this tutorial, we’ll make the tank move by itself, using three simple rules:

- If the tank
*can*move to the right, it will - If the tank
*cannot*move the the right, it will:- Move up, if it is in the lower half of the screen;
- Move down, if it is in the top half of the screen.

- When the tank reaches the right side of the screen, it is respawned at the left side.

The main object that we will be working on is a `Tank`

:

|
11
12
13
14
15
|
class Tank
{
public:
};
|

Put this code in `game.cpp`

, right above the `Game::Init()`

method. Once you have that in place, you can create your tank:

|
16 |
Tank mytank;
|

So now you can make variables of type `Tank`

. The object does not yet have any properties though, and it can’t do anything yet… Our particular tank will need to perform one task: Move. We want to draw it once every time the `Game::Tick`

method is executed, so when it moves, it should do one step.

In terms of properties for our tank, there are a few obvious ones: position (`x`

and `y`

), and orientation (`rotation`

). Considering this, the tank class now becomes:

|
11
12
13
14
16
|
class Tank
{
public:
void Move();
};
|

When we first create a tank, we need to set its `x`

and `y`

and `rotation`

properties. Until now, you would have done this in the `Game::Init()`

function, but now there is a better way. It is called a *constructor*, and it looks like this:

|
11
12
13
14
15
16
17
18
20
21
22
|
class Tank
{
public:
Tank()
{
x = 0;
y = 4 * 64;
rotation = 0;
void Move();
int x, y, rotation;
};
|

A *constructor* has the same name as the class and it has no return value. A constructor can take arguments in which case it is called a *parameterized constructor*. In this case, the constructor doesn’t take any arguments and in this case it’s called a *default constructor*.

The good thing is that when you create your tank (by creating a variable of type `Tank`

), the constructor is executed. So, basically the constructor is the `Init`

method of your class. And, best of all, each class can have its own, and it’s executed automatically for you.

Now that we have a `Tank`

variable (called `mytank`

), we can use it. First of all, we can access its properties: `mytank.x`

, `mytank.y`

and `mytank.rotation`

. We can also make it do something. Add the following line to your `Game::Tick`

function:

|
58 |
mytank.Move();
|

When you compile the program, you will get a linker error ([LNK2019](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/tool-errors/linker-tools-error-lnk2019)). We told C++ that there exists a `Tank`

object, and that it can be moved using the `Move`

method, but we didn’t specify what happens when the `Move`

method is called. Let’s fix that. In the `Tank`

class, replace `void Move();`

by:

|
20
21
22
23
24
25
|
void Tank::Move()
{
x++;
if (x > 800) x = 0;
tank.Draw( screen, x, y );
}
|

Note that this does not implement all the rules [specified earlier](https://www.3dgep.com#Tank_Rules), we’ll save that for the assignment. 🙂

When you try to compile this code, you will get another error. This time, a compiler error ([C2065](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-1/compiler-error-c2065)). The above code assumes that `screen`

member variable can be used in the `Tank`

class, but apparently it cannot… There is a reason for that: `screen`

belongs to another object, which is called `Game`

, and we can’t just access it. Even though this is annoying right now, this is actually good: member variables belong to their own object. This allows us to use `x`

and `y`

in a `Tank`

class, and `x`

and `y`

in a `Bullet`

class as well: the `Tank`

‘s `x`

and `y`

variables will be referred to (in our program) as `mytank.x`

and `mytank.y`

; `x`

for a `Bullet`

might be `mightybullet.x`

. And, if there are multiple bullets, they all have their own `x`

and `y`

variables: `bullet1.x`

, `bullet2.x`

, and so on.

Where and how a variable can be accessed is referred to as the *scope* of the variable. Refer to [Scope](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/scope) for more information about scope in a C++ program.

That doesn’t solve the `screen`

problem, obviously. Luckily, the solution is not hard. The game does know about `screen`

, and the game moves the tank. So, the game should tell the tank about the `Surface`

as well. Like this:

|
63 |
mytank.Move( screen );
|

And, the tank should listen to that. Update the `Tank`

‘s `Move`

method to this:

|
21
22
23
25
|
{
x++;
if (x > 800) x = 0;
}
|

Note that it’s not called `screen`

anymore, because it is a different variable now: it’s a function argument. This time, all is well, and the tank does its limited behaviour, which you get to fix in the assignment.

A few final words before you start hacking away: You have been using classes without knowing it. There is a `Game`

class, a `Surface`

class, and a `Sprite`

class. And the template has a few more objects, which you didn’t use yet.

Having a class means nothing by the way; you merely tell C++ what something looks like. To actually create something, you create a variable of that type, such as `mytank`

. This variable is called an *instance*. Each instance has its own set of *member variables*, as defined in the *class definition*.

You use classes for many reasons:

- It allows you to think in high-level concepts before you get to the details;
- It groups data on a per-object basis rather than in one big messy pool;
- It groups data and the code that operates on that data.

We will dive deeper in the subject at a later time. For now, you know enough for the…

There are three challenge levels for this assignment. You are encouraged to tackle the basic task first. When you are up for a greater challenge, you can move on to the intermediate and hard challenges.

- Using what you learned from
[Part 11](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-11-tiles/), correctly implement the three rules for the tank object[described above](https://www.3dgep.com#Tank_Rules), using the collision code and full-screen map from episode 11. - Using what you learned from
[Part 10](https://www.3dgep.com/cpp-fast-track-10-arrays/), make an array of tanks. Each tank starts at a random tile, and executes the same rules.

- Expand task 2 so that no two tanks start at the same tile.
- Move the tank class to its own set of files: a
`tank.h`

for the class definition, and a`tank.cpp`

for the implementation of the functions.

- Expand task 3 so that no two tanks occupy the same tile while walking the scene. In other words: tanks should detect each other and not be allowed to intersect.
- Make a class for the tile map rendering code so that you can separate its data (tiles, width, height, …) and functionality (draw, collisions, …) from the game code. Doing this will allow you to easily reuse the tile map code in another project.
