I have written about the Go programming language [before](https://blog.s-schoener.com/2018-02-17-a-week-with-go/). There, I made clear that I (among other things) disagree with Go’s choice to not include a templating mechanism or generic types.

Now, a few months later, I still stand by that but want to provide some evidence as to why I don’t like the choice. What follows is a part of a function from a Go code base that I am contributing to. Rest assured that once I saw this monstrosity I made room in my schedule to simplify it and clean it up (in fact, what you see below has been simplified a bit for this post).

```
// search the AI-inventory for the object representing the product
invSlotLoop:
for _, invSlot := range aiInv.Slots {
if invSlot.IsObject() {
objectID := invSlot.ObjectID()
// is it the right product?
product, isProduct := aiHan.pool.Product.TryGet(objectID)
if isProduct && product.BlueprintID == job.BlueprintID {
// are all the slots that the current job should install done?
for _, jobSlotIndex := range job.BlueprintSlotIndices {
if !product.IsSlotInstalled(jobSlotIndex) {
continue invSlotLoop
}
}
// all slots done! this is our product!
// get it to one of the output inventories.
productStorable := aiHan.pool.Storable.Get(objectID)
outInvLoop:
for _, outInvEnt := range workplace.OutputInventories {
outInv := aiHan.pool.Inventory.Get(outInvEnt)
for _, outInvSlot := range outInv.Slots {
if outInvSlot.IsEmpty() && outInvSlot.IsCompatible(objectID, productStorable) {
// we have found an inventory where we can put it! walk to the inventory!
hasToWalk, err := aiHan.walkToEntity(aiEnt, outInvEnt)
if err != nil {
// nah, we can't walk to it. have to find another inventory
continue outInvLoop
}
if hasToWalk {
// walking is triggered, wait until he gets there
return
}
// transfer the object
aiHan.invTransferMan.Transfer(aiEnt, outInvEnt, nil, objectID)
}
}
}
}
}
}
```


The code above should of course be simplified by introducing a few functions that break the nesting and make it easier to follow the flow; there also is some error handling that I do not agree with.

I count a full 7 (!) levels of nesting, including 2 loops with labels and label-targeted `continue`

s. Of course, Go does not force you to write your code like this, but it definitely makes it easier and much more attractive for people to do it.

Notice how the first `continue`

targeting the outer most loop is essentially checking whether some predicate ( = `!product.IsSlotInstalled`

) is true for any item in a slice. In another language, we might write something like this:

```
if job.BlueprintSlotIndices.Any(x => !product.IsSlotInstalled(x)) {
continue
}
```


In Go, we would have to define `Any`

for each type separately, with its own name like `AnyUInt32`

. Well, it turns out that people don’t really do that. They write out the loop each and every time, because - well - it’s *only* five lines. The piece of code above shows pretty clearly where this is heading.

Functions serve multiple purposes: Firstly, they should encapsulate commonly used code so that you only have to debug it once etc. Secondly, and more importantly, they should abstract away details. While the details of a simple `for`

-loop should be quite familiar to anyone, there is no arguing that within a function such as the one above a call like `xs.Contains(...)`

would be *much* easier to parse 1 than the equivalent 5-line loop, because there are already so many things going on.

By now, I treat each labeled loop in Go as a pretty serious problem. Heck, even just nested loops are suspicious.

Oh, and this is my version of the function from above (with some additional functionality):

```
productEntity, ok := getCompatibleFinishedProductInInventory(job, aiInv)
if !ok {
aiHan.tryTakeProduct(aiEnt, job, job.Crafter, true /* take only finished products */)
return
}
result := aiHan.tryStoreObject(aiEnt, productEntity, workplace.OutputInventories)
if result == AIInventoryTransferResultNoSuitableInventory {
aiHan.setNoSpaceFailState(aiEnt, nil)
aiHan.blockWorker(aiEnt)
} else if result == AIInventoryTransferResultNoPath {
aiHan.setNoPathFailState(aiEnt, ecs.InvalidEntityID)
aiHan.blockWorker(aiEnt)
}
```


-
Also, it would be shorter. I am not convinced that brevity is always a virtue in programming, but some people like Cliff Click argue that the number of bugs created by a programmer is mostly proportional to the lines of code written, not the number of features implemented.
