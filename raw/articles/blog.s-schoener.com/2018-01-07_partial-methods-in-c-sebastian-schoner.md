When I need a break, I often look what is on the horizon for my favorite programming languages to get excited about: Concepts in C++, better value-type support in C#. But sometimes I also get to learn something new about a language I thought I knew inside out. Today was such a day: I learned about partial methods in C#.

### Partial Classes

We are all familiar with partial classes in C#:

```
// in file X_1.cs
partial class X {
// whatever you want in your class
}
// in file X_2.cs
partial class X {
// whatever else you want in your class
}
```


At compile time, the two declarations are merged. All fields, properties, methods, etc. from each of the two declarations are present in the final definition of `X`

.
If you have ever worked with WinForms and the designer for that in VisualStudio, then you have probably been using a lot of `partial`

classes: The WinForms editor generated most of the UI code and you merely implemented a few handlers.
Less known is that you can actually vary the class declaration for partial classes (in some places). For example:

```
// in file X.cs
partial class X {
// whatever you want in your class
}
// in file X_IWhatever.cs
partial class X : IWhatever {
// define how X implements the IWhatever interface
}
```


The interfaces that `X`

implements are simply collected from all declarations of a partial class. I have never used it, but I am sure that there are places where you can put this to good use to put the implementation of an interface into another file.

### Partial Methods

Within a partial class, you can define a partial method like this:

```
partial class X {
// declare the method in on place
partial void myPartialMethod();
}
partial class X {
// define it in another
partial void myPartialMethod() {
}
}
```


This seems to only split the declaration of the method from its definition (as is common practice in C++), but there is more to it. The main feature is that you don’t *have* to provide a definition. You can simply forgo the implementation. In that case, whenever a call to the undefined-but-declared partial method is made, the compiler will silently drop it. Due to this behavior, there are strict restrictions on what methods can be marked partial:

- its return type must be
`void`

, - it cannot declare an access modifier and is automatically
`private`

, - it cannot have
`out`

parameters (but`ref`

is fine), - it cannot be
`extern`

.

For more information, see the [C# programming guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/classes-and-structs/partial-classes-and-methods#partial-methods).
In the context of GUI development and WinForms, this behavior of partial methods makes perfect sense. The programming guide mentions that `partial`

methods are to be treated like events (think `OnButtonClicked`

etc.), and there is no need to respond to every single event.

Is there another good usecase for partial methods? I am not sure whether I would really advise making use of this feature. If you want a quick way to disable a call to a method without changing each callsite, you should rather use the [Conditional attribute](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.conditionalattribute?view=netframework-4.7.1). The particularly nasty thing about partial methods is that *by design* the compiler won’t complain if the implementation is missing, and that by itself almost entirely rules out using this feature.
