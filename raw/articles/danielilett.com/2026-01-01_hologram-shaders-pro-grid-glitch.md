# Properties

## Basic PBR Properties

These properties control the basic interactions between Unity’s lighting and the object. Includes the crucial emissive color settings that control the appearance of the holograms.

**Output Mode**- Controls whether the shader outputs color to Base Color, Emission, or both.**Base Color**- Controls the color of the object.**Base Texture**- Also controls the color of the object. This is multiplied by**Base Color**.**Normal Texture**- Used to change the normal vectors on the surface, which influences lighting interactions. May not be noticeable due to the usage of bright emissive light.**Normal Strength**- A value between 0 and 1 which controls how strongly the**Normal Texture**impacts the surface normals.**Alpha Clip Threshold**- Any pixel with an output alpha value below this value is culled entirely.**Metallic**- A value of 0 means the lighting on the surface is like a non-metal (wood, paper, plastic). 1 means it is like metal**Smoothness**- A value of 0 means the object is completely rough. 1 means it is highly polished and smooth.**Ambient Occlusion**- A value of 0 means no ambient light reaches the object. 1 means the full ambient light reaches the object.

## Vertex Glitches

This type of glitch effect pulls individual vertices of the object to the side (away from the center of the object).

**Use Vertex Glitches**- A Boolean value – when on, vertex glitches will be displayed, and when off, vertex glitches are turned off.**Glitch Sensitivity**- How easy it is for a given vertex to fall under the random threshold and start glitching. Higher values mean a lower chance to glitch. This is a value between 0 and 1 that I recommend keeping very high (above 0.99) unless you want a lot of glitches.**Glitch Normal Multiplier**- A multiplier weight value applied to each component of the normal vector for calculating the offsets, e.g. (1, 0, 1) will pull vertices only along the X-Z plane.**Glitch Strength**- How far glitches vertices extend from their original position along their vertex normal.**Glitch Offset**- A time offset – you can use two materials with identical settings except a different offset, and they won’t glitch at the same time.**Glitch Frequency**- How often glitches occur.

## Segment Glitches

This type of glitch effect takes a horizontal slice of the object and pulls all the vertices in the slice in a specified direction briefly.

**Use Slice Glitches**- A Boolean value – when on, slice glitches will be displayed, and when off, slice glitches are turned off.**Slice Width**- The width, in world space, along the y-axis that the glitch takes up**Slice Speed**- How quickly the glitch effect scrolls down the object**Slice Frequency**- How often glitches occur.**Slice Jitter**- A slight random offset which makes it appear as if the glitch jitters. Probably don’t set it too high or the shader may flash too rapidly (capped to 0.2 by default).**Slice Duration**- How long a slice glitch event occurs for.**Slice Direction**- The direction in which all vertices in the glitch are pulled in world space.

## Grid

**Rotation Axis**- The axis around which world space rotates.**Rotation Radians**- The amount of rotation around**Rotation Axis**, in radians.**Per Axis Strength**- The visibility of the gridlines along each axis. Set any one of these values to 0 to turn off gridlines along that axis.**Grid Density**- How closely-packed the gridlines are to each other.**Line Thickness**- How thick each gridline is in world space units.**Line Falloff**- How much falloff there is along the edge of a gridline before the gridline is completely gone.**Grid Offset**- An offset of the grid in world space along the three axes.**Grid Velocity**- The speed at which the grid scrolls along the three axes. Can be set to 0.

## Fresnel

Fresnel adds light to the edge/rim of an object.

**Fresnel Power**- The size of the Fresnel/rim. Higher values mean the rim is smaller, but this should be a value above 0.**Fresnel Color**- Color of the Fresnel/rim light. Can be different to the**Base Color**.**Use Scene Intersections**- Should the shader detect when a pixel is just in front of another scene object? Note: only able to detect opaque objects.**Intersection Power**- The size of the intersections. Larger values mean a thinner intersection glow.
