Many people grew up with older consoles and handhelds such as the Game Boy or the SNES. These retro consoles had a limited colour palette, and the art direction of gamed made for these systems reflected the restrictions placed upon artists. Recently, there has been a revival of classic consoles such as these, with Nintendo cashing in on their fans’ nostalgia with the NES and SNES Classic - today, we are going to use Shader Graph to replicate the unique colour palette restrictions of these consoles, starting with the original Game Boy.

# Game Boy Effect

The original Game Boy could only display four colours, each one a different shade of green. The easiest way for us to make a shader to automatically transform an object to Game Boy colours would be to calculate the luminance of each pixel, then match that up to the four colours, from darkest to lightest. So that’s what we’re going to do! There are two main ways of doing this, so we’ll do both.

## Property-driven Version

For the first method, start by creating a new **Unlit Graph** by going to the Project View and selecting *Create -> Shader -> Unlit Graph*, and name it “GameBoy”. We are going to write a shader which takes lighting into account, but we don’t want Unity to automatically apply lighting, so we won’t be using a **PBR Graph**.

We’ll begin by adding the properties for this shader. We’ll need a `Main Texture`

, of type `Texture2D`

- this will control the base colour of the object before the Game Boy colour transformation is applied. After that, we’ll need to add four `Color`

properties for each of the Game Boy’s four colours. I’m going to name them `Darkest`

, `Dark`

, `Light`

and `Lightest`

, and give them each a default value based on the Game Boy’s original colour palette, with hex values `#0F380F`

, `#306130`

, `#8AAB0F`

, and `#BBCF5D`

respectively. Finally, we will add a **keyword** to control whether to take lighting into account. That way, you can toggle between enabling and disabling lighting using a checkbox on the material Inspector. Go to *Keyword -> Boolean*, and name it something descriptive `Use Lighting?`

, with a reference value of `USE_LIGHTING_ON`

. The `_ON`

needs to be there to make the keyword toggleable in the Inspector.

*Hippity hoppity, here are my properties.*

We want to modify lighting information inside Shader Graph, but unfortunately there’s not yet a node that lets us access it. Fortunately, we can write our own custom nodes using shader code. This section is based on [an excellent article](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/07/31/custom-lighting-in-shader-graph-expanding-your-graphs-in-2019/) by Alex Lindman on the Unity Blog site, so if you’re not interested in code you can just copy the required code from her article under the “Using the Custom Function File Mode” subheading and skip ahead in the article.

Start by creating a new file. We’re going to write a single function, with a `void`

return type, called `MainLight_half`

; the `half`

is important because this tells Unity the precision to expect this function to use. We’ll see later that we can override the precision used, so if we wanted to, we could write another function called `MainLight_float`

, but we won’t worry about that here. This function is going to output diffuse lighting information from a single light, but you can include specular light and additional point lights if you follow the rest of the article.

This function’s parameters are a `float3`

called `WorldPos`

- this will be the world position of a pixel; an `out half3`

called `Direction`

, which lets us output the light’s direction to our shader graph; an `out half3`

called `Color`

to denote the light colour; and finally two `half`

parameters called `DistanceAtten`

and `ShadowAtten`

, to output the light attenuation due to distance and presence of shadows respectively. Attenuation just means that the light strength has a smooth falloff over distance and in shadow.

```
void MainLight_half(float3 WorldPos, out half3 Direction, out half3 Color,
out half DistanceAtten, out half ShadowAtten)
{
}
```


When this code is running on an object in Shader Graph, we need to create a fake light to make sure the preview windows are rendered properly. Use the `#if SHADERGRAPH_PREVIEW`

directive to check if we’re inside a preview window, and if so, create some default values for each of the four output variables.

```
#if SHADERGRAPH_PREVIEW
Direction = half3(0.5, 0.5, 0);
Color = 1;
DistanceAtten = 1;
ShadowAtten = 1;
#else
#endif
```


Else, the code is likely running in the Scene or Game view so it should be able to find a real light to work with. Between the `#else`

and `#endif`

, we’ll need to use `#if SHADOWS_SCREEN`

because some types of light apply shadow maps in screenspace. In that case, we can first transform the `WorldPos`

we passed into the function from world space to clip space using the `TransformWorldToHClip`

function, then convert it to a shadow coordinate using `ComputeScreenPos`

. Otherwise, if `SHADOWS_SCREEN`

is not defined, that means shadows are calculated on the object’s geometry instead, so we can just use `TransformWorldToShadowCoord`

.

```
#if SHADOWS_SCREEN
half4 clipPos = TransformWorldToHClip(WorldPos);
half4 shadowCoord = ComputeScreenPos(clipPos);
#else
half4 shadowCoord = TransformWorldToShadowCoord(WorldPos);
#endif
```


Once we’ve got the shadow coordinates, we can grab the main light using `GetMainLight`

, making sure we pass in `shadowCoord`

to get the correct shadow attenuation for our pixel’s world position. The light gives us direct access to each of the four output variables, so just set each of them in turn and then the script is complete. Save it somewhere sensible as an HLSL file - I called mine “Lighting.hlsl”.

```
Light mainLight = GetMainLight(shadowCoord);
Direction = mainLight.direction;
Color = mainLight.color;
DistanceAtten = mainLight.distanceAttenuation;
ShadowAtten = mainLight.shadowAttenuation;
```


Here is the full code if you just want to copy it all over at once:

```
void MainLight_half(float3 WorldPos, out half3 Direction, out half3 Color,
out half DistanceAtten, out half ShadowAtten)
{
#if SHADERGRAPH_PREVIEW
Direction = half3(0.5, 0.5, 0);
Color = 1;
DistanceAtten = 1;
ShadowAtten = 1;
#else
#if SHADOWS_SCREEN
half4 clipPos = TransformWorldToHClip(WorldPos);
half4 shadowCoord = ComputeScreenPos(clipPos);
#else
half4 shadowCoord = TransformWorldToShadowCoord(WorldPos);
#endif
Light mainLight = GetMainLight(shadowCoord);
Direction = mainLight.direction;
Color = mainLight.color;
DistanceAtten = mainLight.distanceAttenuation;
ShadowAtten = mainLight.shadowAttenuation;
#endif
}
```


Return to the GameBoy shader graph and create a new `Custom Function`

node. By clicking the cog menu, we can insert custom shader code into this node and modify the inputs and outputs to the node to match the parameters of the function we just wrote. Go ahead and add a single input called `WorldPos`

, of type `Vector3`

, then four outputs called `Direction`

, `Color`

, `DistanceAtten`

and `ShadownAtten`

, of types `Vector3`

, `Vector3`

, `Vector1`

and `Vector1`

respectively. We’ll need to type the name of the function in the **Name** field, but leave out the `_half`

and just type `MainLight`

, then attach the Lighting.hlsl file we just wrote to the **Source** field. Finally, we need to set the precision at the top to **Half**, and your node should turn an off-green colour. If you had created an alternative function called `MainLight_float`

, this is where you would pick between them.

Now we can create a new `Position`

node in **World** space and hook that up to the **WorldPos** input on the `Custom Function`

node. Now that we can access diffuse lighting information, we need to apply that to our mesh by using the dot product between the `Normal Vector`

of the mesh and the direction of the light. On the preview, you’ll see it shows us a lit sphere as intended. Use a `Saturate`

node to make sure the values are bound between 0 and 1, then we’ll apply **ShadowAtten**, **DistanceAtten** and **Color** by multiplying them all together using two new `Multiply`

nodes, then finally use another `Multiply`

node to tie everything together. I’m also going to go one step further and `Add`

the scene’s `Ambient Light`

. We can output this all to the **Color** pin on the `Unlit Master`

node to see the final preview of what the lighting looks like.

![GameBoy Lighting](../../assets/43c83cf24ae6b728.jpg)

*In which we make sure things are appropriately #lit.*

There’s still a way to go with the Game Boy shader, and all this lighting code is going to be needed later on in other shader graphs. Rather than copy-pasting this entire network of nodes, we can select all of them except the `Master`

node, right-click and select *Convert to Sub Graph*. A **sub graph** allows us to wrap a group of nodes together and then use them in additional shader graphs as if they are a single node. We’ll name this sub graph something along the lines of “GetLighting”, and the GameBoy graph will update accordingly to show only a `GetLighting`

node feeding into the **Color** pin. If we look at the `GetLighting`

graph, all the nodes are connected in the same way - the only exception is that there’s a new `Output`

node. We can rename it by going to the cog menu, double-clicking the name of the output - let’s call it something like “Light”. If we go back to the `GameBoy`

graph, the name will update accordingly.

![Lighting Subgraph](../../assets/43b86fe9a9c69687.jpg)

*A subgraph only works as part of the collective, #communism.*

Now we can apply the lighting to the model. Drag the `Main Texture`

onto the graph and use a `Sample Texture 2D`

node to grab the albedo colour for this object. If we then `Multiply`

by the light value from `GetLighting`

, it’ll apply the lighting to our base texture. However, we also included `Use Lighting`

as an optional keyword, so we’ll need to use that keyword’s node to tell Unity which values to use when lighting is on or off. Pass the result of the `Multiply`

into the **On** slot, and then pass the **RGBA** output of the `Sample Texture 2D`

node to the **Off** slot. Now, the output of the `Use Lighting`

keyword node gives us a lit or unlit texture based on whether `Use Lighting`

is ticked.

![Apply Lighting](../../assets/293ecc18b49859fc.jpg)

*The Shader Graph equivalent of a light switch.*

Next, we need to determine the **luminance**, or brightness, of the pixel. We can do that by doing the `Dot Product`

of the pixel’s color with a new `Vector3`

with values `(0.2126, 0.7152, 0.0722)`

. You won’t see a difference immediately because our default texture is already greyscale, so if we mess with the `Main Texture`

value, we will see a change between the previews on `Use Lighting`

and `Dot Product`

.

![Calculate Luminance](../../assets/152fe54ec0566dbd.jpg)

*This part of the graph is particularly illuminating.*

Finally, we will determine which Game Boy green colour to use based on the luminance value. We can do this using a `Comparison`

node, which compares the **A** and **B** values based on the comparison type specified on the drop-down menu. We’re going to check if the pixel luminance is greater than 0.75, which we pass into a `Branch`

node’s **Predicate** field. For its **True** output, pass in the `Lightest`

property - in effect, we’re saying “if the luminance is greater than 0.75, then output the lightest green”. We’ll need to pass something into the **False** slot. For that, create another `Comparison`

node to check if the luminance is greater than 0.5. The result gets output to another `Branch`

node, with the `Light`

property slotted into the **True** field. The output of that `Branch`

node will be output to the **False** field of the previous `Branch`

node.

Finally, to factor in the final two colors, create a third `Comparison`

node to check if the luminance is greater than 0.25. Output that to a third new `Branch`

node and slot the `Dark`

property into the **True** field, and the `Darkest`

property into the **False** field. The output of the third `Branch`

can be input to the second `Branch`

node’s **False** field. We can play around with different textures to instantly see different results on the preview windows. Finally, output the first `Branch`

node to the **Color** field on `Unlit Master`

to complete the `GameBoy`

shader.

![Comparison & Branch](../../assets/efd7dfb47a149a60.jpg)

*Pretty straightforward, compared to other methods.*

## Ramp-controlled Version

As I mentioned, I want to show you two ways of achieving a Game Boy effect, so I’ve duplicated the Game Boy shader graph and named the new one “GameBoyRamp” - you’ll see why it’s named that shortly. Go to the end of the graph and delete the group of `Comparison`

and `Branch`

nodes after we calculate the luminance. Also, for this second technique, we don’t need the four `Color`

properties, so also delete these.

In their place, add a new `Texture2D`

called `Ramp Texture`

. A ramp texture lets us encode a gradient of colours to use within a shader - in this case, I’ve created a texture which contains the four Game Boy colours, each taking up a quarter of the texture’s width. If you’d like to use this texture, it’s contained in the GitHub repository for this project. I’ve set that as the default value for this property. I also add a `SamplerState`

property called `Ramp Sampler State`

. A `Sampler State`

is a collection of settings used to sample a texture - using one of these, we can override the filter mode and wrap mode of a texture and ignore the settings used in the texture import window. We want to change the **Wrap Mode** to **Clamp** to avoid glitches where the luminance calculation equals exactly one or exactly zero, because if it is set to *Repeat* then Unity will blend together the two colours at the far ends of the ramp texture.

![GameBoy Properties](../../assets/00474eb6092a3cc0.jpg)

*Swiggity swooty, here’s some properties again.*

Use a `Saturate`

node to ensure the luminance is clamped between 0 and 1, then create a brand new `Vector2`

, using the luminance as the x-component. Set the y-component to 0.5, then use this `Vector2`

as a `UV`

coordinate to sample the `Ramp Texture`

using a `Sample Texture 2D`

node. Remember to connect the `Ramp Sampler State`

to the **Sampler** field, and finally output the sample to the **Color** field on `Unlit Master`

to complete this shader. The difference between both approaches is subtle, but you’ll notice that edges tend to be softer using the texture ramp method.

![Ramp Sample](../../assets/9679791e14d199df.jpg)

*This graph is ample when the ramp is sampled.*

It’s down to preference which approach you take, but each has advantages: the property-driven version gives you full control within the material inspector to change the colour values however you’d like, but the ramp texture approach supports an arbitrary colour ramp, so you can encode more than 4 colours at whatever luminance thresholds you’d like.

Now that we’ve completed the Game Boy shader, we’ll move on to a SNES-style shader.

# SNES Effect

For this effect, we’re not going to accurately emulate how the SNES handles colour exactly, because it’s actually pretty complicated - it can display 256 colours at a time out of a total of 32768. Programming that restriction in a shader would be extremely cumbersome. Instead, we’re going to quantise the colours so that each colour channel only has a limited range of values.

Let’s start by creating another new **Unlit Graph** called “SNES”. Add a `Main Texture`

property of type `Texture2D`

, then add a new `Vector1`

property called `Quantisation`

, with a default value of around 6. It’s important that we set the **Mode** to **Integer** for this property. We’ll also need to add a `Use Lighting`

keyword like we did for the Game Boy shader - give it the same name and reference as before. We’ll set up the lighting the same way as before, so add a `Get Lighting`

node. Read the `Main Texture`

using a `Sample Texture 2D`

node, and `Multiply`

the two together. To pick between enabling and disabling the lighting, add a `Use Lighting`

keyword node and connect the `Multiply`

node to the **On** field, and the **RGBA** from the `Sample Texture`

node to the **Off** field.

![SNES Properties](../../assets/432acda5efacf8fb.jpg)

*I’ve run out of puns to do with the word “property”.*

We’re going to perform the quantisation calculations on each colour channel in turn, so use a `Split`

node to separate each colour channel. We’re going to `Subtract`

a small epsilon value so that the colour channel value never quite reaches 1, then `Multiply`

by the `Quantisation`

value. After that, we’ll use a `Floor`

node to truncate the value to an integer. The next step is optional - if we `Add`

0.5, then the final output ends up looking a bit less dark and oversaturated, but feel free to leave this node out if you want. Finally, we need to divide by `Quantisation`

minus 1 to get our values in the correct range, so drag a `Divide`

node off the `Add`

node, then take the `Quantisation`

property, `Subtract`

1 from it, and pass that to the other pin on the `Divide`

node. Remember that we’re building a new color, so output this into new `Vector3`

node in its first input pin. Connect that to the **Color** pin on `Unlit Master`

, and you should see the main preview change to red.

![SNES Quantisation](../../assets/c0a7d5d851fe581f.jpg)

*Quantisation is like turning a smooth curve into steps.*

We could just copy and paste this for each color channel, but earlier we saw that sub graphs are great for reusing code, so select everything in between the `Split`

and `Vector3`

nodes, right-click and *Convert to Sub Graph*. Name this something along the lines of “Quantise”. You’ll see that, as before, it’s replaced everything with a new node, but it’s messed up slightly and takes two `Quantisation`

inputs when it just needs to take one. We can quickly find the sub-graph by right-clicking the node and selecting *Open Sub Graph*. On the left-hand side, the properties are the inputs to this sub graph. We don’t need two versions of `Quantisation`

, so go ahead and delete one of them, then drag the existing `Quantisation`

property and plug it into the slot where the duplicate got deleted. I also think the `Vector1`

input can be more descriptive - it’s meant to represent a color channel value, so rename it “Color”. Similarly, go and change the output’s name to “OutColor”.

![Quantise Subgraph](../../assets/f6c01f3283f25dee.jpg)

*Cleaning up the Quantisation code.*

Back on the SNES graph, connect the `Quantisation`

property to the `Quantisation`

pin, then copy and paste the pair of nodes a couple of times. Connect the **G** and **B** components of the `Split`

node to the new `Quantise`

nodes, then feed their outputs to the **Y** and **Z** components of the `Vector3`

respectively to complete the shader.

![SNES Channels](../../assets/7abf8b03fe1c1891.jpg)

*Channel-by-channel quantisation.*

We can play around with different textures and toggle the lighting to see the difference it makes to the output. The same goes for the Game Boy shader - the difference between lit and unlit is interesting. Furthermore, if we want to make this look more like the NES, with its far more restrictive colour space, we can just tone down the `Quantisation`

level. See if you can integrate more interesting lighting using the remainder of [Alex’s tutorial](https://blogs.unity3d.com/2019/07/31/custom-lighting-in-shader-graph-expanding-your-graphs-in-2019/).

# Conclusion

We’ve used a variety of techniques to recreate the retro feel of classic consoles using Shader Graph. Sometimes, it’s not necessary to emulate the exact technical specifications of those consoles’ displays - an approximation will evoke the same nostalgia from fans. We also have more creative control if we give ourselves a bit of wiggle room. If you really wanted to sell this effect, I’d recommend pixelating the image, although creating custom image effects in URP is a bit technical and might put some people off.

# Next Time

For the next shader tutorial, I’m going to deconstruct the **Octocamo** mechanic in Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots. We’ll write the shader to change Snake’s comouflage seamlessly between two different textures, and we’ll use code to detect the texture on the floor or wall he is leaning or crawling on, whether it’s a `MeshRenderer`

for the wall or a Unity terrain for the floor. It’s my first time using Unity’s newer terrain system, so I’m excited to put the effect together! Until next time, keep on making shaders!
